## 📖 About The Project

A convenient tip calculator app that helps users determine how much they should tip their waiter(ess) and how to split up the bill. I built this app during Week 1 of my full-stack development journey to practice ES6 JavaScript concepts such as the spread operator and destructuring.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Calculate Tip Amount**: Calculate the amount to tip based on tip percentage
- **Calculate Total Bill**: Calculate the total bill including the tip amount
- **Calculate Amount Per Person**: Easily determine how much each person should pay

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

What users need before they can run your project:

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

<!--
### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to project directory**
   ```bash
   cd project-name
   ```

3. **[If API key needed] Add your API key**
   - Open `script.js`
   - Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual key:
   ```javascript
   const apiKey = 'your-actual-api-key';
   ```
   - Get your free API key at: [link to API signup]

4. **Open in browser**
   - Simply open `index.html` in your browser
   - OR use Live Server extension in VS Code
-->

### Usage

1.  Enter the amount of your bill
2.  Enter the percentage of tip you would like to add
3.  Enter the number of people splitting the bill
4.  Click/tap Calculate

## 💡 What I Learned

Building this project taught me:

- **Destructuring**: How to work with destructuring for clean, efficient code.
- **Spread/Rest Operators**: Writing cleaner code by avoiding writing several lines
<!--

### Challenges Overcome

- **Challenge**: API rate limiting was causing errors with rapid searches
  - **Solution**: Implemented debouncing to delay API calls until user stops typing

- **Challenge**: Pagination was confusing with filtering active
  - **Solution**: Reset to page 1 when filters change and clearly indicate active filters

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- [ ] Quick tip buttons
- [ ] Real-time calculation
- [ ] Save to localStorage
